Your client Komodo Insurance has a number of software development teams.
Create a Team class that allows us to hold the list of Developers on that team along with the team's 
name and ID.
Developers should have an ID, a last name, and whether or not they have access to a Pluralsight 
account or not.
The Team should be able to add new members and remove members by their ID.
After this is set up, Komodo will need a Repository that will have the ability to:
  Hold all of the existing Teams
  Have the ability to create new teams
  Get a team by its ID
  Delete a team by its ID
